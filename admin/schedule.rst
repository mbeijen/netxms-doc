Task can be created by user or by system.

Overall access rights:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Access right
     - Description
   * - Manage user scheduled tasks
     - Option to add, view, edit, delete users' tasks
   * - Manage own scheduled tasks
     - Option to add, view, edit, delete tasks created by this user
   * - Manage all scheduled tasks
     - Option to add, view, edit, delete tasks created by user and system

Task specific access rights:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Schedule type
     - Required access right
   * - File Upload
     - Schedule file upload task
   * - Script Execution
     - Schedule script task
   * - Maintenance
     - Schedule object maintenance

For some tasks like :guilabel:`File.Upload` there is also checked if this user has right
to upload file to this node and if there is an access to the specific folder. Access rights
like this are checked while task execution, not while scheduling. If user does not have
access, then task will just fail.
